**TOPIC: MOLECULAR DOCKING**

Molecular docking is a well-established computational method used extensively in drug discovery. This technique allows for the identification of new therapeutic compounds by predicting how ligands interact with their target proteins at the molecular level and by outlining structure-activity relationships (SAR), even without prior knowledge of the chemical structure of other modulators (Pinzi & Rastelli, 2019). Docking models the interaction between a small molecule and a protein at an atomic level, helping to understand how these molecules behave in the target protein's binding site and revealing key biochemical processes. The docking process involves two main steps: predicting the ligand's conformation, position, and orientation within the binding site (known as the pose), and evaluating the binding affinity (Luca & Giulio, 2019). Efficiency in docking is often improved when the binding site is known in advance (Meng et al., 2011). Ultimately, molecular docking aims to computationally predict the structure of the ligand-receptor complex. This is done by sampling various conformations of the ligand within the protein's active site and then ranking these conformations using a scoring function (Bhagat et al., 2021). To accurately perform the docking process, it is necessary to have high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures, NMR data, or homology-modeled structures with an identified binding site. Additionally, docking helps to comprehend the connections between various molecular targets involved in a specific disease, which is highly significant for polypharmacology and modern drug discovery as a whole (Adelusi, _et al., _2022).

Figure 1. Main applications of molecular docking in current drug discovery.

 

With advancements in docking algorithms and the growing availability of open-access data on ligands and targets, the use of molecular docking in drug discovery is expanding rapidly. Initially, it was primarily employed to study molecular interactions between ligands and targets. However, today its application has broadened, with a notable shift in focus. Molecular docking is now used in virtual screening, target discovery and profiling, predicting drug side effects, polypharmacology, and drug repurposing (Muhammed, 2024). Molecular docking is also applied to various cancer stem cell-related pathways, including metabolic and signaling pathways. Focusing on metabolic pathways, the modifications caused by cancer cells can lead to the production of metabolic precursors, which fulfill the anabolic and energetic needs of cancer cells (Arjmand, et al., 2022).

 

In conclusion, molecular docking offers a range of tools for drug design and discovery. It effectively predicts ligand binding within receptors, making it an integral part of the drug design process. It is time-efficient, cost-effective, and essential for developing new drugs.
